# Arduino-Christmas-Lights

Goal:
Use Arduino to turn christmas lights on and off automatically and to have lights blink with a certain pattern


Materials:
1 Arduino
4 relays
4 sockets
small wires to connect up arduino and relays
thicker wires to connect socket to relays
computer power supply to get power from socket and convert it to 5V for Arduino
(any other source of 5V is ok, like computer)


The code can be used with any amout of christmas lights <= 4 but with more relays and minor changes it can work with any number of lights:

int pins[] = {28,26,24,22};  // <== ADD more values for the pins where your relays are connected

The pattern generated by the lights is random but you can preset values to make your own patterns:


  for(int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++){
    pinMode(pins[i],OUTPUT); // set output type for relay pins
    states[i] = LOW; // set initial relay states to all on
    patternRates[i] = random(2,20); // set pattern constants       //<== Set your own constants for custom pattern
  }
  
  OR you can write it like this
  
  patternRates[0] = 3;
  patternRates[1] = 5;
    .
    .
    .
